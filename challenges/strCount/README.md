strCount Coding Challenge
=========================

Challenge
---------

Create a function 'strCount()' that accepts two string arguments and returns
an integer representing the count of occurrences the second argument is
found in the first.  If no occurrence is found, a count of zero should be
returned.  The first argument can be the empty string; the second argument
will always be of length one.

Example

    arg1 => 'abcb'
    arg2 => 'b'
    return ==> 2
