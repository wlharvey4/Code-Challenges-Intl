The Game
--------

Players take  turns counting incrementally,  replacing any number  divisible by
three with the word "fizz", any number  divisible by five with the word "buzz",
and any number divisible by both three and five with the word "fizzbuzz".

How to Play
-----------

Players generally sit in a circle.  The  player designated to go first says the
number "1",  and each player thenceforth  counts one number in  turn.  However,
any number  divisible by three  should be replaced by  the word 'fizz'  and any
number  divisible by  five should  be replaced  by the  word 'buzz'.   Finally,
numbers  divisible by  both three  and five  become 'fizzbuzz'.   A player  who
hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
