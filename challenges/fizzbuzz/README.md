=========================

About
-----

Fizz buzz is a group word game for children to teach them about division.

Players take turns to count incrementally, replacing any number divisible by
three with the word "fizz", any number divisible by five with the word
"buzz", and any number divisible by both three and five with the word
"fizzbuzz".

How to Play
-----------

Players generally sit in a circle. The player designated to go first says the
number "1", and each player thenceforth counts one number in turn.  However,
any number divisible by three is replaced by the word fizz and any divisible
by five by the word buzz.  Numbers divisible by both become fizz buzz.  A
player who hesitates or makes a mistake is eliminated from the game.
